            <h3>Yala National Park</h3>
            <p>Yala National Park, situated in the southeastern corner of Sri Lanka, is renowned for 
                its diverse wildlife, and leopards are one of its star attractions. The park boasts a 
                healthy leopard population, offering visitors a unique opportunity to witness these 
                elusive big cats in their natural habitat. Yala's varied landscapes, including dense 
                jungles, open grasslands, and coastal areas, provide an ideal environment for leopards 
                to thrive. The park's leopard density is among the highest in the world, making it a 
                prime destination for wildlife enthusiasts and photographers.</p>

            <h3>Wilpattu National Park</h3>
            <p>Wilpattu National Park, located in the northwest of Sri Lanka, is the largest national 
                park in the country and a haven for wildlife, including the majestic leopard. The park's 
                diverse ecosystems, encompassing dense forests, scrublands, and serene lakes, create an 
                ideal setting for leopards to roam freely. Wilpattu is known for its unique natural 
                lakes called "villus," where leopards often come to quench their thirst. Visitors to 
                Wilpattu have the chance to encounter leopards in their natural surroundings, adding to 
                the park's allure as a top wildlife destination.</p>

            <h3>Kumana National Park</h3>
            <p>Kumana National Park, situated on the southeastern coast of Sri Lanka, is renowned for 
                its avian diversity, but it also provides a habitat for leopards. The park's combination 
                of wetlands, lagoons, and dry forests creates a unique environment that supports a 
                variety of wildlife, including leopards. While leopards may be more challenging to spot 
                in Kumana compared to some other parks, the opportunity to see these elusive predators 
                adds an exciting dimension to the park's rich biodiversity. Visitors can experience the 
                thrill of encountering leopards alongside a wealth of bird species in Kumana National 
                Park.</p>

    <h2>Leopard Threats and Conservation Efforts</h2>
    <br>
    <p>The existence of leopards, the magnificent big cats that are indigenous to Sri Lanka, is threatened 
        by numerous obstacles. This section examines the two main threats that these elusive animals face 
        and the current conservation initiatives meant to lessen the risks associated with them. We hope to 
        raise awareness of the urgent problems pertaining to leopard conservation in Sri Lanka and emphasize 
        the vital actions done to protect these amazing animals for future generations by providing 
        insightful descriptions, powerful images, and connections to pertinent conservation organizations.</p>

<!-- Two Sections Side by Side -->
<div class="side-by-side">
    <!-- Section 1 with Animated Picture -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Poaching and Illegal Wildlife Trade</h2>
        <img class="animated-picture" src="threat-1.jpg" alt="Animated Picture 1">
        <p><b>Description:</b> The illegal wildlife trade and poaching pose a serious threat to Sri Lanka's 
            leopard populations. Poachers hunt these magnificent cats because of the illegal market's 
            demand for leopard parts and skins, which causes the population of these magnificent cats to 
            decline.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Consequences:</b>The effects of poaching are terrible. In addition to putting individual 
            leopards in danger, it throws the ecosystem's delicate balance off balance. Furthermore, the 
            natural regulation of prey populations is upset by the disappearance of leopards, which has 
            an effect on the region's overall biodiversity.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Mitigation Mechanisms:</b>Tight law enforcement, anti-poaching patrols, and cooperation 
            with local communities are all part of conservation efforts aimed at preventing poaching. 
            The impact of the illegal wildlife trade must be made public, and educational initiatives 
            are essential to instilling a sense of duty and pride in the protection of leopards.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Human-Leopard Conflict</h2>
        <img class="animated-picture" src="threat2.webp" alt="Animated Picture 2">
        <p><b>Description:</b> A serious threat to leopards in Sri Lanka is conflict between humans and 
            leopards. Conflicts between humans and leopards intensify as human populations grow and 
            invade natural habitats. The loss of prey for leopards, the fragmentation of their habitat, 
            and the leopards' ongoing hunt for food are some of the factors that contribute to this 
            conflict.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Consequences:</b> Due to disruptions in their natural prey sources, leopards have been 
            encroaching into human settlements as a result of the increase in human-leopard conflict in 
            Sri Lanka. This has increased the possibility of conflicts leading to fatalities and serious 
            injuries to people. Additionally, communities escalate the threat by killing leopards in 
            retaliation out of fear for their own safety.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Mitigation Mechanisms:</b> Numerous actions have been taken to address this issue. 
            Programs for raising community awareness emphasize rules for safeguarding livestock and 
            disposing of waste while educating residents about the behavior of leopards and encouraging 
            cohabitation. While early warning systems notify communities and allow for prompt preventive 
            action, the construction of secure enclosures for livestock aids in the prevention of 
            leopard attacks. The goal of conservation policies that support sustainable land use and 
            habitat protection is to ensure long-term conservation while promoting peaceful coexistence 
            between humans and leopards.</p>
